This document provides an in-depth analysis of stock returns for AMD, including comparisons to its competitors, regression modeling, and tests for statistical assumptions. Key findings include the significance of peer returns and the SP500 index as predictors of AMD's performance. Diagnostic tests reveal issues with normality in residuals but support homoscedasticity and independence. The document further compares models for different time periods, evaluates excess returns, and estimates potential market damages. Additionally, a final model incorporates lagged volume and other predictors to assess trading activity.
